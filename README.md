# Mass-File-Renamer
This PowerShell script takes a list of computers, and renames files.

Originally written to mitigate unsupported MSXML parser core services found in NESUS scans.  Modify script for whatever file and directory on a local Windows machine that you need renamed.  Then create a CSV with a list of computers you need to make the change to.
